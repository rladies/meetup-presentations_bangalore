## Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?

---
# Data set `mpg`

Observations collected by US EPA on 38 models of cars

```{r}
head(ggplot2::mpg)
```

- `displ` : car's engine size

- `hwy` : car's fuel efficiency on the highway in miles per gallon

- type `?mpg` to learn more about the dataset

???
a car with low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with high fuel efficiency for the same distance

# Common Problems

- Make sure that every `(` is matched with a `)` 

- Make sure that every `"` is paired with another `"`

- Make sure that `+` is in the right place: it has to come at the end of the line, not the start. The following code will **not work**

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) 
+ geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

- Look for help by typing `?function_name`
  - scroll down to examples
  
- Look at the error message  
  - *try googling the error message*


???
As you start to run R code, you’re likely to run into problems. Don’t worry — it happens to everyone. I have been writing R code for years, and every day I still write code that doesn’t work! Start by carefully comparing the code that you’re running to the code in the book. R is extremely picky, and a misplaced character can make all the difference.
---
####*Let's look at the plot again*

![](images/cars.png)
---
```{r my_cars3, include = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data=mpg)+ #BREAK
  aes(x=displ)+#BREAK
  aes(y=hwy)+#BREAK
  aes(color=class)+ #BREAK2
  geom_point() #BREAK
                 
```

`r chunk_reveal("my_cars3", break_type = "non_seq", title="#Aesthetics")`

---
```{r my_cars4, include = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data=mpg)+ #BREAK
  aes(x=displ)+#BREAK
  aes(y=hwy)+#BREAK
  aes(shape=class)+ #BREAK2
  geom_point() #BREAK
                 
```

`r chunk_reveal("my_cars4", break_type = "non_seq", title="#Aesthetics")`

---
# Aesthetics
Setting the properties of `geom` manually
```{r fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue") #<<
```

--

Here, the color "blue" doesn’t convey information about a variable, but only changes the appearance of the plot
---
# Aesthetics

To set a geometric property manually, place it outside of `aes()`

- The name of a color as a character string

- The size of a point in mm

- The shape of a point as a number

  geom_point() + #BREAK2
  geom_smooth()

```
`r chunk_reveal("geoms2", break_type = "auto", title="##Mulitple geoms")`
???
If you place mappings in a geom function, ggplot2 will treat them as local mappings for the layer. It will use these mappings to extend or overwrite the global mappings for that layer only. This makes it possible to display different aesthetics in different layers.
---
```{r geoms3, include=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(
         x = displ, 
         y = hwy)) + #BREAK
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(
      color = class)) + #BREAK2
  geom_smooth()

```
`r chunk_reveal("geoms3", break_type = "auto", title="##Mulitple geoms")`
---
##Where to place `aes()`

- If `aes()` function is placed inside ggplot(), the same `aes` is used for all layers

- If `aes()` is placed outside ggplot() function then its definition is used for the specific layer

- Multiple `aes()` can be defined for multiple geometries within the same plot

```{r geoms4, include=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

You can find out which `stat` each `geom` uses by looking at the default value of the `stat` argument of the help page.

What it the default `stat` for `geom_bar`?

- The date/time field should be named `date` 
- The wind speed and wind direction should be named `ws` and `wd` respectively
- If you have data from more than one site include a column named `site`

The principal reason for insisting on specific input data

```
???
 The plots in the left panel show the time series data, where blue shows the presence of data and red missing
data. The daily mean values are also shown in pale yellow scaled to cover the range in the data
from zero to the maximum daily value. As such, the daily values are indicative of an overall
trend rather than conveying quantitative information. For each pollutant, the overall summary
statistics are given. For each year the percentage data capture is shown in green font. The
